Sync Todoist Alexa Shopping List with HA Shopping List

This is a fork of MrLemur's original code found at https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sync-your-alexa-todoist-shopping-list-to-the-home-assistant-shopping-list.  All credit to MrLemur for doing the hard work.
All I did was update it with my limited python knowledge to use async calls instead of task.executor.
